So this was a test for me to start working with zed, uv, and properly do python projects.
im going to start doing advent of code on dec 1st. Prob at midnight because my sleep schedule is that bad
For now im going to just write how I got this working properly to help me remember next time

0. install python
  this is 0 because I already did this so I don't think you need to but there is a 'uv python install xxx' where xxx is the version
  remember to restart whatever terminal you are using after installing them but before checking if ENV's are there
1. make the project in uv
  use the command 'uv init --app'
  there was also something about using 'uv sync' but I think thats for projects that exist but you are moving to uv? IDK
2. open the project in zed.
  you can just navigate to it in windows explorer and click on the task bar and type 'zed' same as you do with 'cmd'
  diffrent from the directory you need to open the project (Ctrl-o) or open the sidebar (bottom left) and follow that
and after that it should be good
OpenAI was crap at helping me but the docs were good

tommorow I want to work on freshining up on python and maybe doing the first AOC from 2024 to get me in the spirit
